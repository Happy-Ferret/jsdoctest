jsdoctest
=========
*Though this is an initial working version, it's a really hacky and bad
implementation, meant as a proof-of-concept. I'm just putting it online to be on
SVC and push the implementation forward.*

Parses [`jsdoc`](http://usejsdoc.org/) `@example` tags from annotated functions
and runs them as if they were doctests.

Inspired by the [doctest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html) python
library, as well as its [doctestjs](http://doctestjs.org) javascript
implementation.
